## 🎯 Upload Button Now Available!

### **What You Should See in `/admin`:**

1. **Header with two buttons:**
   - 🔵 **"Upload Images"** (blue button) - Click to select image files
   - ⚪ **"Add Product"** (white button) - Add new products

2. **Image Gallery (appears after uploading):**
   - Grid of thumbnail images
   - Hover effects with "Use Image" or "Copy Path" overlays
   - Click images to use them in product editing

### **How to Test Upload (Manual Method):**

1. **Manually add an image** to `/public/images/products/test.jpg`
2. **Refresh `/admin`** - the image should appear in the gallery
3. **Click the image** to copy its path or use it in editing

### **For Full Upload (After Installing Packages):**

```bash
npm install formidable @types/formidable
```

Then the "Upload Images" button will actually upload files from your computer!

## 🎉 **The upload button should now be visible!**

Go to `/admin` and you should see the blue "Upload Images" button next to the "Add Product" button. Even without the full upload functionality, you can manually add images to test the interface. 🚀
