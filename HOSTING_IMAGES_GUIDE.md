# 🌐 Hosting & Image Visibility Guide

## ✅ Current Setup: Local Server Images

### **How Images Work Now:**
```javascript
// Admin uploads to:
'/public/images/products/filename.jpg'

// Website displays from:
'/images/products/filename.jpg'  // (Next.js serves /public automatically)
```

### **✅ Single Server Hosting:**
- **Vercel**: Images work perfectly
- **Netlify**: Images work perfectly  
- **Railway/Render**: Images work perfectly
- **Any VPS**: Images work perfectly

**Answer: YES! Images will be visible when hosted on a single server.**

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

### **For Multi-Server Setup:**
If admin and website are on different servers, use:

#### **Option 1: Cloud Storage (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Replace upload API with:
npm install cloudinary  // or aws-sdk, or @supabase/storage

// Upload to cloud, get URLs like:
'https://cloudinary.com/your-project/image.jpg'
```

#### **Option 2: Shared Storage**
- Use same database/server for admin + website
- Or use cloud file storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)

## 📁 Current File Structure (Works for Hosting)

```
your-hosted-site.com/
├── images/products/
│   ├── pixelas-card.jpg     ✅ Visible
│   ├── pixelas-modal.jpg    ✅ Visible
│   └── user-uploads.jpg     ✅ Visible
└── admin/                   ✅ Works
```
