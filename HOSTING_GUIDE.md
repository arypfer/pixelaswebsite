# ðŸš€ Hosting Your Website with Local Images

## âœ… YES! Local images work perfectly when hosted

### **How it works:**
- `/public` folder contents â†’ served from `yourdomain.com/`
- `/images/products/photo.jpg` â†’ `yourdomain.com/images/products/photo.jpg`
- Same paths work locally AND when hosted

### **Recommended Hosting Platforms:**
- **Vercel** (best for Next.js)
- **Netlify** (great static hosting)
- **Railway** or **Render** (full-stack)

### **Pre-deployment checklist:**
1. Run `npm run build` - ensure no errors
2. Test locally with `npm run start`
3. Check all image paths load correctly
4. Compress images before uploading to `/public`

### **Performance note:**
- Local images load fast (same domain)
- Next.js optimizes them automatically
- Consider CDN only if you have 100+ large images

**Your setup is hosting-ready!** ðŸŽ‰
